# Equipment-System
#### We needed a new system in which to log in and out equipment from the rooms so that everything can be adequately.
The system as a whole will require it to be managed entirely inside the program so that after the members who create it leave, it can still be used perfectly.

###### Check-Out
For a member to check out an item, they simply need to select checkout, scan (or enter) the barcode reference of the item, then scan (or enter) the ID number of the member checking the item out. Both of these must be numbers (integer values) in order for them to be valid.
If after both of these data values are put in, it still asks for one more field then the executive password must be entered in order to grant checkout to the item.
