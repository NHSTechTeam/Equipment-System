Equipment-System
================

##### Equipment checkout tracking, simplified.

Equipment-System is a simple interface that allows users to check equipment in and out for various uses,
and gives Eboard members an at-a-glance view of the status of the team's equipment. Gone are the days of
having no idea who checked out the cameras - just look at the logs.

### Equipment Management

##### Check-Out
To check out an item, simply select checkout, scan or enter in the barcode reference of the item then the ID number of
the member checking the item out. Both these values are simple integers.

Some items require an Eboard member to authorize checkout.

##### Check-In
Checkin is easy. Just scan the barcode reference of the item they are checking in.
As soon as it is scanned, the item is made available for use by other members.

##### Search
The search function allows for the table to show only what is in the search query. It searches in (mostly) real time. Hitting enter isn't required, but recommended.
