# Equipment-System
#### We needed a new system in which to log in and out equipment from the rooms so that everything can be adequately.
The system as a whole will require it to be managed entirely inside the program so that after the members who create it leave, it can still be used perfectly.

### Equipment Management
##### Check-Out
For a member to check out an item, they simply need to select checkout, scan (or enter) the barcode reference of the item, then scan (or enter) the ID number of the member checking the item out. Both of these must be numbers (integer values) in order for them to be valid.
If after both of these data values are put in, it still asks for one more field then the executive password must be entered in order to grant checkout to the item.
##### Check-In
Checkin is easy. In order for an item to be checked in, a member simply needs to scan the barcode reference of the item they are checking in. As soon as it is scanned, the item is made available for use by other members.
###### Search
The search function allows for the table to show only what is in the search query. It searches in (mostly) real time. Hitting enter isn't required, but recommended.
